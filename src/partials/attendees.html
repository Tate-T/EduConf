          EduConf is an unmissable event. The caliber of speakers was
          exceptional, and the connections I made with fellow educators have
          been invaluable for my research and teaching practices. I'm already
          looking forward to next year.

          implement in our platform. It’s the most forward-thinking conference
          in the EdTech space.
